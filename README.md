Pok√©hack is a full stack app that utilizes the PokeAPI and OpenAI API to allow users to generate their own custom Pok√©mon. Made with React, Node, Express, and MongoDB. Winner of Ironhack Berlin March 2023 Hackshowü•á

# Overview

- User-Centric Design: Pok√©hack boasts an intuitive interface that ensures a seamless and enjoyable experience for users as they delve into the world of custom Pok√©mon creation. The overall design is somewhat inspired by this amazing [Awwwards nominee - Pok√©mon Corporate Website by FOURDIGIT Inc.](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/pokemon-corporate-website)

- Pok√©mon Generation: With the integration of the PokeAPI and OpenAI API, users have the ability to craft their own unique Pok√©mon. The app takes a Pok√©mon name, type, and description provided by the user and packages it as a prompt to the OpenAI API which then generates a custom Pok√©mon image based on the provided inputs. The user can then share their custom Pok√©mon creation in the Community page!

- Authentication and JWT: Secure user registration and login functionality using JWT authentication, ensuring a safe and personalized experience. You only need to register with an email and password to be able to start creating your own custom Pok√©mon.

 - React Components: The app's frontend is built using React components, offering a modular and maintainable code structure.

 - State Management with Context API: To manage state efficiently and simplify data flow between components, the app employs React's Context API for a smooth user experience.

- React Router: Seamlessly navigate between different sections of the app with React Router, featuring route guards to ensure access control.
